    <h1>Inspecting Returned Vehicles and Documenting Damage</h1>
</header>

<main>
    <h2>1. Perform a Visual Inspection</h2>
    <p>Inspect the exterior and interior of the vehicle carefully to identify any visible damage. This includes checking for scratches, dents, or broken parts.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Inspect the body of the vehicle for scratches, dents, or paint damage.</li>
        <li>Check all windows, mirrors, and lights for cracks or damage.</li>
        <li>Look inside the vehicle for any stains, rips, or broken items (seats, dashboard, etc.).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Check Vehicle Functionality</h2>
    <p>Ensure the vehicle's key functions are working properly, such as the engine, brakes, lights, and electronics.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Start the vehicle and listen for any unusual noises from the engine.</li>
        <li>Test the brakes and ensure they are functioning properly.</li>
        <li>Check all lights, including headlights, taillights, and indicators.</li>
        <li>Verify the operation of internal electronics such as the air conditioning and radio.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Document All Findings</h2>
    <p>Accurately record all damage and issues found during the inspection. This documentation is crucial for determining any repairs or charges that need to be made.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Take clear photographs of any visible damage from multiple angles.</li>
        <li>Note down specific details about each damage (location, size, type of damage, etc.).</li>
        <li>Use a checklist or inspection form to ensure all areas are covered.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Report and Address the Issues</h2>
    <p>After the inspection, report the findings to the relevant department or person responsible for handling repairs or customer service.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Submit the documented findings and photos to the appropriate department.</li>
        <li>Determine the next steps (repair, charge the customer, etc.) based on the severity of the damage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Finalize the Inspection Report</h2>
    <p>Ensure that the final inspection report is completed and filed for future reference.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensure the inspection report is clear, detailed, and properly filed.</li>
        <li>Keep a copy of the report in case of any disputes or follow-up needs.</li>
    </ul>
